                    <h1>Sneak Peak - <a class="sneak-peak" href="#">1981 F1 Season Story</a></h1>
                    <p>The 1981 championship was the first to be run under the FIA Formula One World Championship name, replacing both the
                    original World Championship of Drivers and International Cup for Constructors. Under the influence of Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone and the FOCA organisation, teams were asked to sign the first Concorde Agreement, which would set Formula One on course to become a profitable business. The agreement required teams to lodge entries for the entire championship rather than individual races, while the FIA would also set the prize money. A standardised set of rules would be in place at every race and, from 1982 on, the entrants had to own the intellectual rights to the chassis that they entered, as such the distinction between the terms "entrant" and "constructor", and hence also "team", have become less pronounced.</p>
